This is the basic JavaScript template for [Mastro](https://mastrojs.github.io). If you're not already viewing this on github.dev, [open it](https://github.dev/mastrojs/template-basic).

## One-time setup

1. Click **Install** in the small dialog in the bottom right that says "Do you want to install the recommended extensions from mastro and FAST for this repository?"
2. Click **Trust Publishers & Install**
3. Close the two tabs of the just installed extensions ([Mastro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension) and [FAST Tagged Template Literals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-fast.fast-tagged-templates)) and switch back to the _Explorer_ view by clicking the topmost icon ⧉ in the activity bar on the left. Now you should see your files and folders again.


## Open the Mastro preview pane

On your keyboard, hit `Ctrl-Shift-P` (Windows or Linux) or `Command-Shift-P` (Mac), type `mastro`, and when the _mastro: Preview and Generate Website_ item appears, hit enter.

Try to remember how to open the Mastro preview pane, as you might sometimes close it.

<summary>Using Firefox?</summary>

In Firefox, this keyboard shortcut unfortunately opens a new incognito window. Instead, you need to hit `Ctrl-P` (Windows or Linux) or `Command-P` (Mac) and type `>mastro` (note the `>`).

## Create your own repository

While you can play around in the template repository, if you want to save your changes, you need to create your own copy of the repo – if you haven't done so already.

1. Open [this template's GitHub repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic)
2. Click the green button **Use this template** on the top right, select **Create a new repository** and choose a name for your project. (On the free tier, your repo needs to be public.)
2. On your repo's GitHub page, press `.` on your keyboard to again open _Visual Studio Code for the Web_.


## Next Steps

Congratulations! If the above worked, you can skip the "Setup" chapter of the [Mastro guide](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/) and continue with learning [HTML](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/html/), [CSS](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/css/), or [JavaScript](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/javascript/).
Or if you know all that already, skip ahead even further to one of the following chapters:

- [Publish your website to GitHub Pages](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/publish-website/)
- [Client-side vs server-side JavaScript, SPA vs MPA](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/client-side-vs-server-side-javascript-static-vs-ondemand-spa-vs-mpa/)
- [Mastro components and routing](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/server-side-components-and-routing/)

If instead of following the guide, you just want a condensed overview of the Mastro web framework and static site generator, then head straight for the [Mastro Docs](https://mastrojs.github.io/docs/).
