This is the basic JavaScript template for [Mastro](https://mastrojs.github.io). If you're not already viewing this on github.dev, [open it](https://github.dev/mastrojs/template-basic).

## One-time setup

1. Click **Install** in the small dialog in the bottom right that says "Do you want to install the recommended extensions from mastro and FAST for this repository?"
2. Click **Trust Publishers & Install**
3. Close the two tabs of the just installed extensions ([Mastro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mastro.mastro-vscode-extension) and [FAST Tagged Template Literals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-fast.fast-tagged-templates)) and switch back to the _Explorer_ view (the topmost icon in the activity bar on the left) to see the folders and files.


## Open the Mastro preview pane

On your keyboard, hit `Ctrl-Shift-P` (Windows or Linux) or `Command-Shift-P` (Mac), type `mastro`, and when the _mastro: Preview and Generate Website_ item appears, hit enter.


## Next steps

### Create your own repo

While you can play around in the template repository, if you want to save your changes, you need to create your own copy of the repo:

1. Click the green "Use this template" button on the top right of [this template's GitHub repo](https://github.com/mastrojs/template-basic) and select "Create a new repository".
2. On your repo's GitHub page, press `.` on your keyboard to again open _Visual Studio Code for the Web_. If you already know HTML and CSS, you can skip ahead to [this chapter in the guide](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/multiple-pages-with-shared-components/).
3. Save your changes and [publish your website](https://mastrojs.github.io/guide/html/#publish-your-website)!
